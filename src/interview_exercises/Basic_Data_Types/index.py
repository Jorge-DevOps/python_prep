# Python Practice Exercises

# Exercise 1: Generate a set from input numbers
# Goal: Practice working with sets in Python.
# Example Input: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"
# Expected Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
# Solution:

# Exercise 2: Create a dictionary mapping words to their lengths
# Goal: Practice creating dictionaries with comprehensions.
# Example Input: "apple banana cherry"
# Expected Output: {"apple": 5, "banana": 6, "cherry": 6}
# Solution:


# Exercise 3: Generate a list of squares of even numbers
# Goal: Practice list comprehensions with conditions.
# Example Input: "1 2 3 4 5 6"
# Expected Output: [4, 16, 36]
# Solution:


# Exercise 4: Filter unique palindromes from input
# Goal: Practice using sets and string manipulation.
# Example Input: "madam racecar apple level civic"
# Expected Output: {"madam", "racecar", "level", "civic"}
# Solution:


# Exercise 5: Create a matrix (list of lists)
# Goal: Practice creating and manipulating nested lists.
# Example Input: Rows = 3, Columns = 3
# Expected Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
# Solution:


# Exercise 6: Flatten a matrix into a single list
# Goal: Practice working with nested lists and list comprehensions.
# Example Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Solution:


# Exercise 7: Generate a list of unique characters from a string
# Goal: Practice working with sets and string processing.
# Example Input: "hello world"
# Expected Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'o', 'w', 'r', 'd']
# Solution:


# Exercise 8: Transpose a matrix
# Goal: Practice manipulating nested lists.
# Example Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Expected Output: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
# Solution:


# Exercise 9: Filter and sort unique words by length
# Goal: Practice using sets and sorting.
# Example Input: "banana apple cherry apple banana"
# Expected Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
# Solution:


# Exercise 10: Find all pairs of numbers that add up to a target
# Goal: Practice working with nested loops in comprehensions.
# Example Input: "1 2 3 4 5", Target = 6
# Expected Output: [(1, 5), (2, 4)]
# Solution:
